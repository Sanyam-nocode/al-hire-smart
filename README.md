Hire Al: Talent Matchmaking

Problem

Al companies and enterprises struggle to fill specialized roles quickly. Scarcity of qualified candidates, manual sourcing, inefficient screening, and bias stretch the average time to hire past 60 days and push costs sky-high. An LLM-driven, natural language search engine that understands skills, projects, and context promises to compress this cycle from weeks to minutes

Solution

Build an end-to-end hiring copilot that lets recruiters type a plain-English request

(e.g., "Find senior Gen-Al engineers with Lang Chain RAG experience in Europe, open to contract work") and instantly returns relevant candidates, auto-screens them, and sends personalized outreach

Scope

•	Natural-language multi-source talent search (“People GPT”)

•	Auto-resume parsing & skill extraction

•	Talent-pool insights dashboards (charts)

•	Candidate Ranking: Automatically ranks, scores, and organizes candidate profiles based on recruiter criteria, eliminating manual screening

•	Background Checking and Pre-Screening

	Uses Al to verify candidate information and generate screening Q&A for assessment

•	Sends personalized outreach
